# 🌍 Life Expectancy Analysis

## 📌 Project Description
This project explores global life expectancy trends and identifies key health, economic, and social factors influencing it. Using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, we uncover insights that help understand disparities between countries and regions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between life expectancy and various features like GDP, schooling, mortality, and alcohol consumption.
- Compare trends between developed and developing countries.
- Identify strong positive and negative correlations.
- Provide data-driven policy suggestions for improving life expectancy.

## 🗂️ Dataset Information
- **Source**: WHO & UN Data
- **Columns**:  
  `Country`, `Year`, `Life expectancy`, `GDP`, `Schooling`, `Alcohol`, `Adult Mortality`, `Hepatitis B`, `BMI`, etc.
- **Size**: 2,938 rows × 22 columns  
- **Target Variable**: `Life expectancy`

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scipy (for statistical testing)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Null values handled using mean/median imputation.
- Visualized:
  - Life expectancy trends over the years.
  - Correlation heatmaps.
  - Boxplots by development status.
- Detected strong correlations:
  - **Positive**: Schooling, GDP, Immunization
  - **Negative**: Adult mortality, Infant deaths, Alcohol use

## 📈 Key Insights
- Developed countries consistently show higher life expectancy.
- GDP and education are strongly linked to longer life.
- Public health initiatives like vaccinations have measurable impact.

## ✅ Conclusion
Life expectancy is influenced by both socio-economic and healthcare factors. This analysis emphasizes the importance of:
- Increasing access to education.
- Investing in public health systems.
- Improving economic conditions in developing countries.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Apply machine learning regression (e.g., Linear, Random Forest) to predict life expectancy.
- Use clustering to group countries based on health indicators.
- Build a dashboard for interactive visualization.
