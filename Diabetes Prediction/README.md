# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Project

This project uses a dataset of medical diagnostic measurements to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 768 records of female patients with the following features:

| Feature       | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pregnancies` | Number of times the patient has been pregnant                |
| `glucose`     | Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)                         |
| `diastolic`   | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)                             |
| `triceps`     | Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)                              |
| `insulin`     | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)                               |
| `bmi`         | Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)              |
| `dpf`         | Diabetes Pedigree Function (genetic predisposition)          |
| `age`         | Age of the patient (in years)                                |
| `diabetes`    | Target variable (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic)             |

## 🎯 Objective

To build a classification model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic features.

---

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for missing values (zeroes in some columns treated as missing).
- Analyzed distribution of features.
- Reviewed class balance of the `diabetes` column (~35% positive).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning

---

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Handle missing or zero values
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Train-test split
- Apply ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluate with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
