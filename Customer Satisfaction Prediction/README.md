# 📊 Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **customer satisfaction ratings** based on support ticket data from a tech product company. The goal is to help businesses understand which factors contribute most to customer experience and use that insight to improve service quality.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of historical customer support tickets, each with detailed information such as:

- Customer demographics (age, gender)
- Product purchased
- Ticket type and status
- Time to first response and resolution
- Ticket channel (email, phone, chat, etc.)
- Customer satisfaction rating (1 to 5)

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can **predict the satisfaction rating** a customer will give based on their support interaction. This enables businesses to identify areas of improvement in customer service.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – modeling and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – development environment

## 🧪 ML Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Understand the structure, types, and missing values

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Null handling, encoding categorical variables, scaling

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create or transform useful features if needed

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained using `RandomForestClassifier`

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** ~21.66% *(needs improvement – model likely underfitting or data imbalance issues present)*

---

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Use advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Convert satisfaction rating into binary classification (satisfied/unsatisfied)
- Address class imbalance
- Integrate with a live dashboard for business teams

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to customer service data to predict customer satisfaction. Though the initial accuracy is low, it lays the groundwork for further refinement and real-world business application.
